Miniloupe is a silly name for a standalone rendering library.
It consists of a backend called libmilo.a and a frontend called view
which communicate through a socket.
The API for rendering using libmilo is in milo.h.
The backend does not depend on any graphics hardware or software,
it just uses libpng to dump images for convenience.
The frontend uses GTK+ 2.0 to hold its GUI together.

This project has two dependencies: libpng and GTK+ 2.0
It finds them through pkg-config by default, edit the makefile
if this doesn't work out.

To build and try whats currently there, just type
	make
You should now have programs "test" and "view".
The viewer should be run as follows, given a port
number on which it will listen (pick a random high number):
	./view 4242
The test program should then be run given the
hostname and port number where the viewer is running:
	./test localhost 4242
Then you should be able to click the "accept" button
in the view program and a test image will show up.

To install the programs, library, and header file, run
	make install prefix=/path/to/install/dir/
